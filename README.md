## Intro

This is a React application that displays a list of people with their birthdays. The application fetches the data from a local file and renders it using the PeopleList component.

The main component of the application is called App, which uses the useState hook to manage the state of the data. It also contains a button that allows the user to clear the list of people or refresh the page to fetch new data.

The PeopleList component receives the data as a prop and maps over it to render a list of individual cards for each person with their name, image, and birthday.
